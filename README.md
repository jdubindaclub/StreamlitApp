Stat 386 Homework 5 - Deploy Streamlit App.

## About my app

Using a dataset of customer data, I analyzed the data and trained a classification model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn. On the app itself, you can enter the data of a new customer and press the 'Predict' button. The web application will then display whether or not the customer is likely to churn. Past predictions are stored and displayed.
